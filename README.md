# DS-MUS-TO-MIDI

### What is this?

This aims to re-create music sequences from Nintendo DS games which use a custom mus file format which is not typical for DS games. Existing DS music extractor tools such as VGMTrans fail to extract the data for this reason.

List of games with these weird files:

- Brain Voyage
- M&Ms Game (?)

### What is the state of this?

In progress. See commit notes for more details.
